# X-Ray Image Classification

This project is part of my Bachelor’s degree work.  
The aim of this project is to classify chest X-ray images using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

The model analyzes X-ray images and helps in identifying different conditions based on image patterns.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- OpenCV 


projectbsc.ipynb : Main Jupyter Notebook containing code for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  


## Dataset
The project uses a chest X-ray image dataset for training and testing.
Due to large file size, the complete dataset may not be fully uploaded to GitHub.
Only a sample dataset or folder structure is provided for reference.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open `projectbsc.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook
2. Install required Python libraries
3. Run the notebook cells step by step

## Note
This project is developed for academic purposes and learning.
